# AI-Powered-Music-Recommendation-System
This project is an interactive web application that predicts the genre of uploaded music files and recommends popular songs from the same genre. Built with Streamlit for the user interface and powered by a TensorFlow deep learning model, it processes audio data, predicts its genre, and displays top recommendations using a clustered music dataset.
